# Django Food App

Django Food App is a web application built with Django, comprising two apps: `food` and `user`. The `food` app allows users to perform CRUD operations on food items, 
including adding, updating, and deleting items with details such as item name, price, description, and image. The `user` app provides user authentication features, 
including registration, login, and logout.
